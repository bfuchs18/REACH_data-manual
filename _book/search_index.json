The first 4 visits occur ~1 week apart; these are referred to as baseline or session 1 visits. The 5th visit occurs ~1 year after baseline; this visit is referred to as follow-up or session 2 @ref(fig:reach_visits). The 4 baseline visits include: Child Visit Protocol 1, Child Visit Protocol 2, Child Visit Protocol 3, and Child Visit Protocol 4. Child Visit Protocol 1 always occurred on the first study visit, while Child Visit Protocols 2-4 could vary in order due to MRI availability. The follow-up visit includes Child Visit Protocol 5.

The conda env can be created from the yml file by running the following commands in a Bash terminal on Roar Collab # if conda has not been initialized, may need to run this first and then close and reopen terminal conda init bash # Navigate to yml file cd /storage/group/klk37/default/R01_Marketing/bids/code/dcm2bids/ # Load anaconda module load anaconda # Create a conda environment based on yml file ## Note, this will create the conda env in a user-specific directory, so every user has to create their own environment conda env create -f dcm2bids.yml # activate environment conda activate dcm2bids 6.0.5 pydeface pydeface is a tool to remove facial structure from (i.e., “deface”) MRI images. pydeface requires FSL Data processing scripts expect pydeface to be loaded via a conda environment described in /bids/code/dcm2bids/dcm2bids.yml.

By using this singularity container, we can use a version of fMRIprep that is not presently available to all users of Roar Collab. The container was created by running the following command in a Bash terminal on Roar Collab singularity build /storage/group/klk37/default/sw/fmriprep-24.0.1.simg docker://nipreps/fmriprep:24.0.1 Version 24.0.1 was selected for processing because it is (or was) the most recent version available.
